Keywords: Keywords are specially reserved words which we use for various functionalities.
Ex: for, while, True, False, if, else, elif, del, and, or, not etc.

Variables: 
Variables are used to store the values in a program. We can assign a value to a variable and
use it whenever we want in the program.
Ex: x = 5, y = 10, name = "John"

Note: A variable name cannot be a reserved keyword.

Data types:
Data types are used to specify the type of data that a variable can hold. 

Python has the following
data types:

1. Integers: These are whole numbers, either positive, negative or zero.
Ex: 1, 2, 3, 0 ,-1, -2, -3 etc

2. Floats: These are decimal numbers.
Ex: 3.14, -0.56, 0.0 etc

3. Strings: These are sequences of characters.
Ex: "Hello", 'Hello', "John's car", 'John's car' etc

4. Boolean: These are true or false values.
Ex: True, False

5. List: These are ordered collections of items.
Ex: [1, 2, 3], ["apple", "banana", "cherry]

6. Tuple: These are ordered, immutable(unchangable) collections of items.
Ex: (1, 2, 3), ("apple", "banana", "cherry)

7. Dictionary: These are unordered collections of key-value pairs.
Ex: {"name": "John", "age": 30}, {"name": "Jane", "age": 25}

8. Set: These are unordered collections of unique items.
Ex: {1, 2, 3}, {"apple", "banana", "cherry}

9. NoneType: This is a special data type that represents the absence of a value.
Ex: None

10. Complex: These are complex numbers.
Ex: 3+4j, -5-6j etc

11. Bytes: These are sequences of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256.
Ex: b'Hello', b'World'
