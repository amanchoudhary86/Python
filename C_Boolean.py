# Boolean data type in Python

'''
A boolean data type stores any one of these two values: True or False
'''

a = True
b = False

# Boolean values can be used in arithmetic operations
print(a + a + a)  # Output: 3, because True is treated as 1 in arithmetic operations
# Similarily, False is treated as 0 inarithmatic operations

# Next data type is called 'List' which will be discussed in the following Module

a = 5
b = 5
c = 10

print(a is b)
# Output: True

print(a is c)
# Output: False

# Note : 'is' keyword is used to compare the id of two operands are same or not
