# Modules:-

# A module is nothing but a python file which contain some python code which is pre-written by some other programmer. Modules are basically used to use the code of some other files to use in our file, as simple as that.

# For example:-
# If we want to use the functions written in the previous file '12_Functions.py', then we firstly we import that particular module int our file like the following:

import L_functions

# Now we can use the functions ar any other part of code of that module in our file.
L_functions.addition(1,5,10)

# on executing this code we get the following output:

# The sum of  1   2   3  is = 6
# The sum of  4   5   6  is = 15
# The sum of  7   8   9  is = 24
# The sum of  10   11   12  is = 33
# The sum of  13   14   15  is = 42
# 10
# The sum of  1   5   10  is = 16
