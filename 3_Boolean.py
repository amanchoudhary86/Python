# Boolean data type in Python

# A boolean data type stores one of two values: True or False
a = True
b = False

# Boolean values can be used in arithmetic operations
print(a + a + a)  # Output: 3, because True is treated as 1 in arithmetic operations

# Next data type is called 'List' which will be discussed in the following Module
