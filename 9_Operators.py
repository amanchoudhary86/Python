# operators are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. They can be used to perform arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and other operations.

# Types of operators:-
# Arithmetic operators-->  +, -, *, /, %, **
# Assignment operators-->  =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=
# Comparison operators-->  ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# Logical operators-->  and, or, not
# Identity operators-->  is, is not
# Membership operators-->  in, not in
# Bitwise operators-->  &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
# Unary operators-->  +(Unary Plus), -(Unary Minus), ~(Unary Bitwise NOT), not(Unary Logical NOT)
# Ternary operators-->  value_if_true if condition1 else condition2
# Special operators-->  lambda, @, :=, **=, //=

# Python operators precedence(The order in which we give them priority order):-

# Priority Order(meaning which are executed first in a single line of code), here is that the priority decreases from top to bottom:-

# 1. Parentheses: `()`, `[]`, `{}`
# 2. Exponentiation: `**`
# 3. Multiplication(`*`), Division(`/`), Modulus(`%`)
# 4. Addition(`+`), Subtraction(`-`)
# 5. Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
# 6. Logical AND: `and`
# 7. Logical OR: `or`
# 8. Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `%=`, `**=`
# 9. Identity: `is`, `is not`
# 10. Membership: `in`, `not in`
# 11. Bitwise AND: `&`
# 12. Bitwise XOR: `^`
# 13. Bitwise OR: `|`
# 14. Bitwise Left Shift: `<<`
# 15. Bitwise Right Shift: `>>`
# 16. Unary Plus: `+`
# 17. Unary Minus: `-`
# 18. Unary Bitwise NOT: `~`
# 19. Logical NOT: `not`
# 20. Ternary: `x if condition else y`
# 21. Special: `del`, `pass`, `continue`, `break`, `return`, `yield`, `raise`, `import`, `from`
# 22. Lambda: `lambda`
# 23. `@` (decorator)
# 24. Assignment Expression: `:=`
# 25. Exponentiation Assignment: `**=`
# 26. Floor Division Assignment: `//=`
# 27. Modulus Assignment: `%=`
# 28. Division Assignment: `/=`
# 29. Multiplication Assignment: `*=`
# 30. Addition Assignment: `+=`
# 31. Subtraction Assignment: `-=`
# 32. Bitwise AND Assignment: `&=`
# 33. Bitwise XOR Assignment: `^=`
# 34. Bitwise OR Assignment: `|=`
# 35. Bitwise Right Shift Assignment: `>>=`

# Note : Some of the operators which are on the same priority and in that case the left-most one will be executed first and so on from left to right.

# Note = Priority order can be changed with the help of paranthesis. 
# Example : 2 * 2 + ( 2 + 2 ) --> Here ( 2 + 2 ) will be calculated first because of paranthesis
