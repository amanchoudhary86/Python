What is a programming language?
Answer. A programming language is a set of rules and instructions that a computer can understand and execute. It is
used to write code, which is a set of instructions that a computer can follow to perform a specific
task. Programming languages are used to communicate with computers and to create software, apps, and
other digital products.

                                    OR

A programming language is simply a tool or a medium to communicate with a computer or a machine.

What is a Compiler?
Answer. Whenever we want to communicate with a machine we use a programming language but any machine in this world only understands 0s and 1s. Meaning this language or a programming language we use needs to be converted in the form of 0s and 1s and this intermediate which converts the normal code into byte code(code in the form of 0s and 1s).

Meaning that a compiler is simply a translator which converts the commands that we give into the form of 0s and 1s which the computer understands.

What is an Interpretor?
Answer. An Interpretor is a program which converts the code into the form of 0s and
1s at the time of execution. Meaning that it does not convert the entire code into the form
of 0s and 1s at the time of compilation but it converts the code into the
form of 0s and 1s at the time of execution.

OR

It simply like the compiler but the difference is that it converts each line one by one. 

Note: The compiler converts the whole file into byte code all at once instead of line by line.

Python Programming uses an Interpretor.

Python is a programming language which is one of the most widely used programming languages over the globe. Python is considered to be the one of the easiest languages in the world as its syntax closely resembles English language which is one of the reason that it is taught in most of the institutions and schools. 

Python was released on 20th February, 1991. (Need not remember it, just a fun fact)
->>meaning that it is even older than JAVA which was released in 1995.

Reasons for Python's popularity:-
1. Easy to learn: Python is considered to be one of the easiest programming languages to learn.

2. Easy to read and write: Python's syntax is simple and easy to read and write.

3. High-level language: Python is a high-level language which means that it abstracts away many
low-level details, making it easier to focus on the logic of the program.

4. Large community: Python has a large and active community which means that there are many
resources available for learning and troubleshooting.

5. Cross-platform: Python can run on multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

6. Extensive libraries: Python has a vast collection of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to
perform various tasks such as data analysis, web development, and more.

7. Rapid development: Python's syntax and nature make it ideal for rapid prototyping and development.

8. Platform Independent: Python programs are typically first compiled into an intermediate code, then the code is run by the interpretor.
