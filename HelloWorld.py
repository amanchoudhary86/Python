#This is a comment and it is the non-executionable part of the code which is used to mention whatever the programmer wants to. Ex: Reference, notes, warnings, etc.


# To diplay output on the console:
print("Hello World")

# To take an input on the console:
input("Exter your value here : ")

# Variables: Variables are containers which contain some value. This value can be on many types and will be discussed further.

# Rules to define a variable:
# 1. Variable name should start with a letter or an underscore.
# 2. Variable name can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.
# 3. Variable name should not contain any special characters.
# 4. Variable name should not contain any space.
# 5. Variable name should not be a keyword.

# Each variable will be studied in the further modules(files) with examples and direct executable steps

# Creating a variable which takes input and then displays it to the console:
VariableName = input("Input your number here : ")

print("Your number is : ", VariableName) # A comma is used to print together two or more strings,integers, etc.
