
# A Dictionary in Python is like a real-world dictionary. Just as a real dictionary connects words to their meanings, a Python dictionary connects keys to values.

# Key Features:-

# 1) Collection of Key-Value Pairs: Each item in a dictionary has a key and a value. You can think of the key as a word and the value as its definition or explanation.

# 2) Unordered: Unlike a list, where items are in a specific order, dictionaries do not store items in any particular order. This means that when you loop through a dictionary, the items may not come out in the order you added them.

# 3) Mutable: You can change a dictionary after it's created. You can add new items, change existing ones, or remove them.

# 4)Indexed: You access the values in a dictionary using their keys, similar to looking up a word in a dictionary to find its meaning.

# This is the latest change
